/**
 * PushConsumer is a thread-safe rocketmq client which is used to consume message by group.
 *
 * <p>Push consumer is fully-managed consumer, if you are confused to choose your consumer, push consumer should be
 * your first consideration.
 *
 * <p>Consumers belong to the same consumer group share messages from server,
 * so consumer in the same group must have the same subscriptionExpressions, otherwise the behavior is
 * undefined. If a new consumer group's consumer is started first time, it consumes from the latest position. Once
 * consumer is started, server records its consumption progress and derives it in subsequent startup.
 *
 * <p>You may intend to maintain different consumption progress for different consumer, different consumer group
 * should be set in this case.
 *
 * <p>To accelerate the message consumption, push consumer applies
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_Streams">reactive streams</a>
 * . Messages received from server is cached locally before consumption,
 * {@link PushConsumerBuilder#setMaxCacheMessageCount(int)} and
 * {@link PushConsumerBuilder#setMaxCacheMessageSizeInBytes(int)} could be used to set the cache threshold in
 * different dimension.
