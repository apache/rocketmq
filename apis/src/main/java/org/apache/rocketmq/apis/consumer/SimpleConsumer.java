/**
 * SimpleConsumer is a thread-safe rocketmq client which is used to consume message by group.
 *
 * <p>Simple consumer is lightweight consumer , if you want fully control the message consumption operation by yourself,
 * simple consumer should be your first consideration.
 *
 * <p>Consumers belong to the same consumer group share messages from server,
 * so consumer in the same group must have the same subscriptionExpressions, otherwise the behavior is
 * undefined. If a new consumer group's consumer is started first time, it consumes from the latest position. Once
 * consumer is started, server records its consumption progress and derives it in subsequent startup.
 *
 * <p>You may intend to maintain different consumption progress for different consumer, different consumer group
 * should be set in this case.
 *
 * <p> Simple consumer divide message consumption to 3 parts.
 * Firstly, call receive api get messages from server; Then process message by yourself; At last, your must call Ack api to commit this message.
 * If there is error when process message ,your can reconsume the message later which control by the invisibleDuration parameter.
 * Also, you can change the invisibleDuration by call changeInvisibleDuration api.
