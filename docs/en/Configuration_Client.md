## Client Configuration

  Relative to RocketMQ's Broker cluster, producers and consumers are client. In this section, it mainly describes the common behavior configuration of producers and consumers.
â€‹ 
### 1 Client Addressing mode

```RocketMQ``` can let client find the ```Name Server```, and then find the ```Broker```by the ```Name Server```. Followings show a variety of configurations, and priority level from highly to lower, the highly priority configurations can override the lower priority configurations.

-  Specified ```Name Server``` address in the code, and multiple ```Name Server``` addresses are separated by semicolons

```java
producer.setNamesrvAddr("192.168.0.1:9876;192.168.0.2:9876");  

consumer.setNamesrvAddr("192.168.0.1:9876;192.168.0.2:9876");
```
- Specified ```Name Server``` address in the Java setup parameters

```text
-Drocketmq.namesrv.addr=192.168.0.1:9876;192.168.0.2:9876  
```
- Specified ```Name Server``` address in the envionment variables

```text
export   NAMESRV_ADDR=192.168.0.1:9876;192.168.0.2:9876   
```
- HTTP static server addressing(default)

After client started, it will access the http static server address, as: <http://jmenv.tbsite.net:8080/rocketmq/nsaddr>, this URL return the following contents:

```text
192.168.0.1:9876;192.168.0.2:9876   
```
By default, the client accesses the HTTP server every 2 minutes, and update the local Name Server address.The URL is hardcoded in the code, you can change the target server by updating ```/etc/hosts``` file, such as add following configuration at the ```/etc/hosts```:
```text
10.232.22.67    jmenv.taobao.net   
```
HTTP static server addressing is recommended, because it is simple client deployment, and the Name Server cluster can be upgraded hot.

### 2 Client Configuration

```DefaultMQProducer```,```TransactionMQProducer```,```DefaultMQPushConsumer```,```DefaultMQPullConsumer``` all extends the ```ClientConfig``` Class, ```ClientConfig``` as the client common configuration class. Client configuration style like getXXX,setXXX, each of the parameters can config by spring and also config their in the code. Such as the ```namesrvAddr``` parameter: ```producer.setNamesrvAddr("192.168.0.1:9876")```, same with the other parameters.

#### 2.1 Client Common Configuration

| Keys           | null   | Optional, represent this message's business keys, server create hash indexes based keys. After setting, you can find message by ```Topics```,```Keys``` in Console system. Because of hash indexes, please make key as unique as possible, such as order number, goods Id and so on.|

| WaitStoreMsgOK | TRUE   | Optional, indicates whether the message is not answered until the server is down.                |
