### Operating system tuning
Before deploying broker servers, it's highly recommended to run **os.sh**, which is to optimize your operating system for better performance.

## Notice
### os.sh should be executed only once with root permission.
### os.sh parameter settings are for reference purpose only. You can tune them according to your target host configurations.


### Start broker
