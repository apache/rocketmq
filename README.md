**[Apache RocketMQ](https://rocketmq.apache.org) is a distributed messaging and streaming platform with low latency, high performance and reliability, trillion-level capacity and flexible scalability.**

It offers a variety of features:

* Messaging patterns including publish/subscribe, request/reply and streaming
* Financial grade transactional message
* Built-in fault tolerance and high availability configuration options base on [DLedger](https://github.com/openmessaging/openmessaging-storage-dledger)
* A variety of cross language clients, such as Java, [C/C++](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-client-cpp), [Python](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-client-python), [Go](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-client-go), [Node.js](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-client-nodejs)
* Pluggable transport protocols, such as TCP, SSL, AIO
* Built-in message tracing capability, also support opentracing
* Versatile big-data and streaming ecosystem integration
* Message retroactivity by time or offset
* Reliable FIFO and strict ordered messaging in the same queue
* Efficient pull and push consumption model
* Million-level message accumulation capacity in a single queue
* Multiple messaging protocols like JMS and OpenMessaging
* Flexible distributed scale-out deployment architecture
* Lightning-fast batch message exchange system
* Various message filter mechanics such as SQL and Tag
* Docker images for isolated testing and cloud isolated clusters
* Feature-rich administrative dashboard for configuration, metrics and monitoring
* Authentication and authorization
* Free open source connectors, for both sources and sinks
* Lightweight real-time computing

## Quick Start

This paragraph guides you through steps of installing RocketMQ in different ways.
For local development and testing, only one instance will be created for each component.

### Run RocketMQ locally

RocketMQ runs on all major operating systems and requires only a Java JDK version 8 or higher to be installed.
To check, run `java -version`:
```shell
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_121"
```

For Windows users, click [here](https://archive.apache.org/dist/rocketmq/4.9.3/rocketmq-all-4.9.3-bin-release.zip) to download the 4.9.3 RocketMQ binary release,
unpack it to your local disk, such as `D:\rocketmq`.
For macOS and Linux users, execute following commands:
```shell
# Download release from the Apache mirror
$ wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/rocketmq/4.9.3/rocketmq-all-4.9.3-bin-release.zip

# Unpack the release
$ unzip rocketmq-all-4.9.3-bin-release.zip
```

Prepare a terminal and change to the extracted `bin` directory:
```shell
$ cd rocketmq-4.9.3/bin
```

**1) Start NameServer**

NameServer will be listening at `0.0.0.0:9876`, make sure that the port is not used by others on the local machine, and then do as follows.

For macOS and Linux users:
```shell
### start Name Server
$ nohup sh mqnamesrv &

### check whether Name Server is successfully started
$ tail -f ~/logs/rocketmqlogs/namesrv.log
The Name Server boot success...
```

For Windows users, you need set environment variables first:
- From the desktop, right click the Computer icon.
- Choose Properties from the context menu.
- Click the Advanced system settings link.
- Click Environment Variables.
- Add Environment `ROCKETMQ_HOME="D:\rocketmq"`. 

Then change directory to rocketmq, type and run:
```shell
$ mqnamesrv.cmd
The Name Server boot success...
```

**2) Start Broker**

For macOS and Linux users:
```shell
### start Broker
$ nohup sh bin/mqbroker -n localhost:9876 &

### check whether Broker is successfully started, eg: Broker's IP is 192.168.1.2, Broker's name is broker-a
$ tail -f ~/logs/rocketmqlogs/broker.log
The broker[broker-a, 192.169.1.2:10911] boot success...
```

For Windows users:
```shell
$ mqbroker.cmd -n localhost:9876
The broker[broker-a, 192.169.1.2:10911] boot success...
```

### Run RocketMQ in Docker

You can run RocketMQ on your own machine within Docker containers,
`host` network will be used to expose listening port in the container.

**1) Start NameServer**

```shell
$ docker run -it --net=host apache/rocketmq ./mqnamesrv
```

**2) Start Broker**

```shell
$ docker run -it --net=host --mount source=/tmp/store,target=/home/rocketmq/store apache/rocketmq ./mqbroker -n localhost:9876
```

### Run RocketMQ in Kubernetes

You can also run a RocketMQ cluster within a Kubernetes cluster using [RocketMQ Operator](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-operator).
Before your operations, make sure that `kubectl` and related kubeconfig file installed on your machine.

**1) Install CRDs**
```shell
### install CRDs
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-operator
$ cd rocketmq-operator && make deploy

### check whether CRDs is successfully installed
$ kubectl get crd | grep rocketmq.apache.org
brokers.rocketmq.apache.org                 2022-05-12T09:23:18Z
consoles.rocketmq.apache.org                2022-05-12T09:23:19Z
nameservices.rocketmq.apache.org            2022-05-12T09:23:18Z
topictransfers.rocketmq.apache.org          2022-05-12T09:23:19Z

### check whether operator is running
$ kubectl get pods | grep rocketmq-operator
rocketmq-operator-6f65c77c49-8hwmj   1/1     Running   0          93s
```

**2) Create Cluster Instance**
```shell
### create RocketMQ cluster resource
$ cd example && kubectl create -f rocketmq_v1alpha1_rocketmq_cluster.yaml

### check whether cluster resources is running
$ kubectl get sts
NAME                 READY   AGE
broker-0-master      1/1     107m
broker-0-replica-1   1/1     107m
name-service         1/1     107m
```
